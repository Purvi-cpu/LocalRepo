# Image_to_text_and_audio
This project aims to build a web application using Django that allows users to upload images, extract text from them using OCR,and convert the extracted text into audio output.
<br><br>
           Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is one of the most widely implemented types of data entry methods.With this tool, you can save a lot of time.
           <br><br>
Productivity needs more time and with this project, you can save your precious time by getting text/audio in seconds.Scanned documents need to be edited most of the time, particularly when some information must be updated. OCR converts data to text, which can be easily edited.In adition to that, you can also generate Audio file from Picture or Text written in the GUI.
<br><br>
Core Features:
<br><br>
1.Image Upload:<br>
   A user-friendly interface to upload images (e.g., JPEG, PNG) through the Django web app.<br>

2.Optical Character Recognition (OCR):<br>
     Utilize a library like Tesseract (via the pytesseract Python wrapper) to extract text from the uploaded images.<br><br>

3.Text-to-Speech Conversion:<br>
      Leverage a text-to-speech (TTS) library such as gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) to convert the extracted text into an audio file.<br><br>

4.Audio Playback:<br>
   Provide a mechanism to play the generated audio within the browser or allow users to download it.<br><br>

5.Technical Components:<br>
          Django Framework: The foundation for the web application, handling routing, views, and templates.<br><br>

6.Python Libraries:<br>
     pytesseract: Interface with the Tesseract OCR engine.<br><br>

7.gTTS: Convert text to speech.<br>
       Pillow (PIL): Image manipulation and processing.<br><br>

8.Front-end Technologies:<br>
       HTML, CSS, JavaScript: For designing the user interface and enhancing user experience.<br><br>
Database:<br>
      Store uploaded images and their associated text/audio data using a database like Mysql.<br><br>



For this, we need to import some Libraries<br><br>

1.Pytesseract(Python-tesseract) : It is an optical character recognition (OCR) tool for python sponsored by google.<br>
2.gTTS : It is an google Text-to-Speech library.<br>
3.Python Imaging Library (PIL) : It adds image processing capabilities to your Python interpreter.<br>
4.Googletrans : It is a free python library that implements the Google Translate API.<br>
5.django : It is a Python framework for webapp development.<br><br><br>



Objective of the project:<br>
1.Accessibility: Assisting visually impaired users by converting printed text into audio.<br>
2.Language Learning: Helping users learn pronunciation and improve listening skills.<br>
3.Content Consumption: Providing an alternative way to consume written content, such as articles or ebooks.<br>
4.Productivity: Enabling users to listen to text while performing other tasks.<br>
